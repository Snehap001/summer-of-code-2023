Developer tools:
The developer tools prove highly beneficial when it comes to comprehending the different aspects of a website, including its features and styling. Furthermore, they enable us to observe real-time modifications to our website, offering an additional advantage of identifying and resolving coding errors.

Elements tab:
By utilizing the elements tab, we can exhibit the code that constructs the website and make temporary adjustments to witness the immediate impact. The code itself is organized in a hierarchical structure known as a tree, with elements nested within one another. The body tag encompasses multiple divs, each of which may contain additional divs, serving as sub-divisions. Divs essentially function as containers that can be visualized on the website by hovering over them.

In the image above I could use the elements tab to make changes in the header of Wikipedia.

Console tab:
The Console tab within the developer tools offers the capability to search for a specific CSS selector and displays the first occurrence of that selector in the output. It also provides insights into any errors or warnings related to the website's loading process. The dot operator (.) possesses multiple other applications, such as accessing location, body, default view, appending, and more. Developers can use the console to log messages, variables, and object properties for debugging purposes.  Through the use of console.log(), they can output information to the console and track the execution flow of their JavaScript code.

Css fullform justified :
While exploring the developer tools, I discovered that certain CSS styles were not being applied to a specific element due to conflicting styles defined elsewhere. This led me to learn about the concepts of cascading and specificity in CSS. CSS styles can be applied to an element in three ways: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. The order of precedence follows the same sequence. For instance, if different styles are specified in inline and internal CSS, the style specified in inline CSS takes precedence over the internal CSS, which, in turn, takes precedence over external CSS. However, the keyword "!important" holds the highest priority, overriding any other styles.

Understanding Network tab:
The network tab serves as a robust tool for analyzing network activity during the webpage loading process. It offers valuable information regarding the HTTP requests generated by the browser while loading the webpage. It allows us to view specific types of requests, such as CSS, images, JavaScript, and more. The "Disable cache" feature enables us to reload the website by generating fresh requests, bypassing any data stored in the disk cache or memory cache of our device. This feature is particularly useful for analyzing and making necessary changes to ensure the effective functionality of our website. Additionally, by utilizing the throttling tab, we can adjust the network speed to simulate low network conditions and evaluate how our website performs under such circumstances.

Disk and Memory cache :
When we uncheck the "Disable cache" option, we observe that numerous requests are made to the memory cache and disk cache, resulting in reduced loading times for our website. The disk cache in a website refers to the practice of storing resources on the user's local disk, thereby minimizing the need for repeated downloads. On the other hand, memory cache involves storing frequently accessed data and resources in the computer's memory, facilitating faster delivery and processing. Enabling the cache significantly reduces the size of the transferred page compared to when the cache is disabled. This reduction in size occurs because the data is retrieved from the user's memory or disk cache, eliminating the necessity to fetch it from the server.
